## Introduction

This Express.js application serves as a foundation for building web applications with user authentication and job-related functionality. It includes various security measures and common middleware to ensure a robust and secure application.

## Middleware

### Rate Limiting

The application utilizes rate limiting to prevent abuse of the APIs. Requests are limited to a maximum of 100 requests every 15 minutes.

### Helmet

[Helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) helps secure your Express application by setting various HTTP headers. It enhances security by adding important security-related headers to HTTP responses.

### CORS

[CORS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) is configured to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, ensuring that your API can be accessed from different origins.

### Error Handling

Error handling middleware is implemented to gracefully handle errors and provide appropriate responses to clients.

## Routes

### Authentication

The `/api/v1/auth` route is responsible for user authentication. It includes routes for registration, login, and other authentication-related functionality.

### Job Management

The `/api/v1/jobs` route handles job management. It is protected by authentication middleware to ensure that only authorized users can access these endpoints.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up a MongoDB database and configure the connection in your application.

## Usage

1. Start the application using `npm run dev`.
2. Access the API endpoints as described in the routes section above.

## Testing

1. The project uses jest for testing, with supertest for routes test.
2. Run Test using `npm run test`
